While GLF OS is primarily focused on Gaming, it also offers tools for content creators with its Studio edition!

This edition includes tools like OBS, Kdenlive, GIMP, Audacity, and especially DaVinci Resolve (free or Studio version).
To use this edition, you can select it during the installation of GLF OS or later using the GLF-OS Environment Selection tool, which allows you to switch desktop environments and editions.
