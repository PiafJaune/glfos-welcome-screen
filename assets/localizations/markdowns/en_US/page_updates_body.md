GLF OS will check for new updates (glf-update) 5 minutes after your PC starts, and then every 12 hours if the PC remains on.

If updates are available, they will be applied in the background.
Youâ€™ll be notified via a notification once the update is complete.
At the next reboot, the system will switch to a new image with the latest updates.
